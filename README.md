# A demo site utilizing HTML, CSS, and JS along with React, React Router, and Bootstrap.

### Deployed at [https://johnoro-demo.netlify.app](https://johnoro-demo.netlify.app)

## Potential extras:

- Add more games in entertainment view
- Flesh out entertainment view functionality (by adding a player and specific dragons, etc.)
- Consider accessibility (i.e. replacing horizontal and vertical rules with just styling)
- Consider responsiveness (i.e. some extra breakpoints outside of what bootstrap already provides)
